# The Problem
### Coding Task-Abstract
Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s in linear time complexity, like this one:
```c
int arr[30] = { 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2};
```
### Description
Given an array consisting only 0s, 1s and 2s, please provide an algorithm sorting that array in
O(n) time complexity. So in the resulting sorted array, 0s will be at starting, then the 1s & then the 2s.
- The usage of built-ins or libraries, like `std::sort` or `boost::sort` is not allowed.
- Coding style and quality is more important than feature completeness.
- What to submit: A git repository of the work and all commits made on the way.
